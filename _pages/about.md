Hi, I'm Lyumanshan Ye, an MS student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Currently, I am a student research intern at the GAIR Lab, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Pengfei Liu. My research focuses on the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

My research interests include:

- Human-AI Interaction
- Natural Language Processing
- User Interface Design
- Adaptive Systems

I am passionate about creating AI systems that can seamlessly integrate with human workflows while maintaining user autonomy and control. My work aims to optimize the delegation of tasks to AI while preserving space for human-intensive decision-making.

You can find my publications on the [publications page]({{ '/publications' | relative_url }}). Feel free to connect with me through the social media links below.
