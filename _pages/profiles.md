  Hi, I'm Lyumanshan Ye, an MS student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
  Currently, I am a student research intern at the GAIR Lab, where I am fortunate
  to be advised by Prof. Pengfei Liu, who fully supports my exploration at the
  intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
  Previously, I earned my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from SJTU.asks to AI while preserving space for human-intensive decision-making. Studying control and autonomy trade-offs â€” designing interfaces and interaction signals that support dynamic adaptation to human behavior patterns. My ultimate goal is to maximize human-AI co-performance by helping AI systems become more collaborative, adaptive, and capable of supporting complex human tasks in an efficient and thoughtful manner.
