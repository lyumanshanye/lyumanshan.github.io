Hi, I'm Lyumanshan Ye, an MS student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Currently, I am a student research intern at the GAIR Lab, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Pengfei Liu, who fully supports my exploration at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

My research focuses on designing and developing intelligent systems that can effectively collaborate with humans. I am particularly interested in:

- Human-AI Interaction
- Natural Language Processing
- User Interface Design
- Adaptive Systems

## Education

- MS in Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University
- Current MS Student, Shanghai Jiao Tong University

## Research Interests

I am passionate about creating AI systems that can seamlessly integrate with human workflows while maintaining user autonomy and control. My work aims to optimize the delegation of tasks to AI while preserving space for human-intensive decision-making.
