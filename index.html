Hi, I'm Lyumanshan Ye, an MS student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Currently, I am a student research intern at the GAIR Lab, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Pengfei Liu, who fully supports my exploration at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Previously, I earned my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from SJTU. I have also had the opportunity to collaborate with Prof. Xin Yi at Tsinghua University and Dr. Qiao Jin at Carnegie Mellon University.

My research focuses on human-AI collaboration, particularly in designing adaptive systems that balance initiative between humans and AI agents. Specifically, I work on:

- Enhancing context-awareness in AI — delegating routine or mechanical tasks to AI while preserving space for human-intensive decision-making
- Studying control and autonomy trade-offs — designing interfaces and interaction signals that support dynamic adaptation to human behavior patterns

My ultimate goal is to maximize human-AI co-performance by helping AI systems become more collaborative, adaptive, and capable of supporting complex human tasks in an efficient and thoughtful manner.
